<div class="left-align-text"> 
The words in this piece are from the poem "Battle" by Yrsa Daley-Ward.  Please read more of her beautiful work at her <a href="https://yrsadaleyward.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.<br />
This comic was a personal exploration for illustrating a poem and to practice risograph printing.  It is not a commerical product and is not in collaboration with the author. <br />
The artwork is my own and depicts my original characters Pyn and Uiro.
